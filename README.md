# Scilab Toolbox Finite Fields

I am using this repository to create a Scilab Toolbox to provide support for [Galois / Finite Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field).

I developed a toolbox for this a long while ago (Circa 2009) for my Bachelor's degree project and I want to update these files to run on the latest Scilab version.

Scilab already provides some [information](https://www.scilab.org/build-a-toolbox) on how to build a toolbox.

I committed the Bachelor's degree thesis and I'll keep it there for a short period of time (it shouldn't be there) but I need it in the repo for reference.

I believe I used C for the core functionality, I hope I can still use that language because I'm not into C++ (as they suggest to use that language to develop the toolbox)
