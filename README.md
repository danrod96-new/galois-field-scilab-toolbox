I am using this repository to create a Scilab Toolbox to provide support for [Galois / Finite Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field).

I developed a toolbox for this a long while ago (Circa 2009) for my Bachelor's project and I want to update these files to run on the latest Scilab version.

Scilab already provides some [information](https://www.scilab.org/build-a-toolbox) on how to build a toolbox.
